1. STORE_SUBSCR : definition "some_dict" not found if some_dict["some_key"] = some_value
2. try except - can create cfg when return from try block
3. MAIN ISSUE:

Dynamically importing modules to get access to code objects inside is unmanageable:
importlib uses standard python strategies for module import,
this means that if a module is already in sys.modules this version is used.
Removing (unloading) a module is impossible due to some issues that are outside of python.
